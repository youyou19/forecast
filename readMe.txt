* Usage
Two applications(Server-Client) are available in order to meet the expectations of the users:

- The Server uses the port 8081:
In order to access the API you can use this url :http://localhost:8081/weatherTomorrow/52557
where 52557 represents the zip code of the city  


I use swagger for publishing the API documentation as an HTML documentation
you can also access the Documentation API on url, e.g http://localhost:8081/

- The Client uses the port 8086:
Once started you can access the Application(WS) on port 8086, e.g. http://localhost:8086/
